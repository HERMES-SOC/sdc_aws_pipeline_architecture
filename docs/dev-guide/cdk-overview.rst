AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) Overview
============================================
The AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) is an open-source software development framework to define cloud infrastructure in code and provision it through AWS CloudFormation. It includes a set of libraries for AWS services and third-party construct libraries, which are open-source extensions that implement infrastructure patterns, with the goal of making it easier to set up best practices.
